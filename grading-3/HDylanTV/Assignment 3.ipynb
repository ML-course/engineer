    "* Part of your grade depends on how well your model performs. When the question says 'you should at least get x%', x% will give you a good but not the maximal grade. You can get the full grade when you are close to what is the expected maximal performance. You don't need to invest lots of effort into the last tiny improvement, though. Unless specified, we look at the accuracy on the validation set. If your learning curves are very erratic we'll compute a score based on the smoothed curves (i.e. single peaks don't count).\n",
