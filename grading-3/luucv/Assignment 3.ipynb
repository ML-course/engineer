    "After your explanation, your approach and model should make perfect sense. Refrain from using symbols as substitute for words in your explanation (e.g. no: \"More layers -> more parameters\" yes: \"More layers mean more parameters\"). \n",
    "* Part of your grade depends on how well your model performs. When the question says 'you should at least get x%', x% will give you a good but not the maximal grade. You can get the full grade when you are close to what is the expected maximal performance. You don't need to invest lots of effort into the last tiny improvement, though. Unless specified, we look at the accuracy on the validation set. If your learning curves are very erratic we'll compute a score based on the smoothed curves (i.e. single peaks don't count).\n",

    "* Don't wait until the last minute to do the assignment. The models take time to train, most questions will require some thinking, and some require you to read up on some new concepts.\n",
    "* Take care that you upload the results as requested. You need to submit not only the notebooks but also the trained models and learning curves (training histories). Be sure to run the verification script and check that all the results are included.\n",
    "* We provide an evaluation function that also stored models to disk. After you are done training the model, set the 'train' attribute to False so that the model doesn't train again (and loads from file instead) when you restart and rerun your notebook.\n",

    "### Question 1.1: Baseline model (4 points)\n",
    "- Build a dense network (with only dense layers) of at least 3 layers that is shaped like a pyramid: The first layer must have many nodes, and every subsequent layer must have increasingly fewer nodes, e.g. half as many. Implement a function 'build_model_1_1' that returns this model.\n",
    "- You can explore different settings, but don't use any preprocessing or regularization yet. You should be able to achieve at least 70% accuracy, but more is of course better. Unless otherwise stated, you can use accuracy as the evaluation metric in all questions.\n",
    "* Add a small description of your design choices (max. 500 characters) in 'answer_q_1_1': explain what you did and also why. Also discuss the performance of the model. Is it working well? Both the performance of the model and your explanations matter.\n",
    "- The name of the model should be 'model_1_1'. Evaluate it using the 'run_evaluation' function. For this question, you should not use more than 50 epochs."
