Carefully read the question and answer\n","what is asked for. Train your models on the correct data. It should be clear on which data should be trained, but ask when in doubt. When something is not defined (e.g. the number of epochs or batch size), you can freely choose them.\n","* Clarity of your explanations. Write short but precise descriptions of what you did and why. Give short but clear explanations of the observed performance. \n","After your explanation, your approach and model should make perfect sense. Refrain from using symbols as substitute for words in your explanation (e.g. no: \"More layers -> more parameters\" yes: \"More layers mean more parameters\"). \n","* Part of your grade depends on how well your model performs. When the question says 'you should at least get x%', x% will give you a good but not the maximal grade. You can get the full grade when you are close to what is the expected maximal performance. You don't need to invest lots of effort into the last tiny improvement, though. Unless specified, we look at the accuracy on the validation set. If your learning curves are very erratic we'll compute a score based on the smoothed curves (i.e. single peaks don't count).\n","* The weight of each question is indicated. Take this into account when planning your time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"KNyA5dEpR00Z"},"source":["### Other tips\n","* Don't wait until the last minute to do the assignment. The models take time to train, most questions will require some thinking, and some require you to read up on some new concepts.\n","* Take care that you upload the results as requested. You need to submit not only the notebooks but also the trained models and learning curves (training histories). Be sure to run the verification script and check that all the results are included.\n","* We provide an evaluation function that also stored models to disk. After you are done training the model, set the 'train' attribute to False so that the model doesn't train again (and loads from file instead) when you restart and rerun your notebook.\n","* Explore. For many questions we'll ask you to explain your model design decisions. You cannot magically know the best solutions but you can experiment\n","based on your understanding and make decisions based on both your knowledge and experiments. Your explanation is at least as important as the performance of your model.\n","* Be original.
