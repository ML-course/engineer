# # Assignment 3

# ### Choice of libraries
# We recommend to use Tensorflow in this assignment since that is what we covered in the labs. If you feel confident using PyTorch (and Skorch for the scikit-learn wrapper), that is allowed too, as long as you are able to implement the requested functions and return the requested data. Read the assignment carefully and ensure that you can. Note that you may also need to do a bit more work to implement certain helper functions and wrappers.

# ### Storing and submitting files
# You must be able to store your models and submit them to GitHub Classroom. The evaluation functions used in this notebook will automatically store models for you.
# 
# If you want to run and solve the notebook on your local machine/laptop, fill in the path 'base_dir' to your assignment folder into the next cell.
# 
# If you use Colab, we recommend that you link it to your Google Drive:  
# * Upload the assignment folder to your Google Drive (+ New > Folder Upload)
# * Open Colab in a browser, open the 'Files' menu in the left sidebar, and click 'Mount Drive'
#   * At this point you may need to authenticate
# * Fill in the path to your assignment folder below
# #   * It's likely '/content/drive/My Drive/assignment-3-yourname'

# In[ ]:


# # base_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/assignment-3-RosenV95' # For Google Colab
#base_dir = './'


# In[ ]:


#Uncomment to link Colab notebook to Google Drive
# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/drive')


# ### Using GPUs
# While you can solve this assignment on a CPU, using a GPU will speed things up training quite a bit. If you have a local GPU, you can use that. If you don't, we recommend Google Colab. When you are in Colab:
# * In Runtime > Change runtime type, select the GPU under Hardware Accelerator
# * Run the 3rd cell on the top of this notebook to check that the GPU is found.
# 
# Note that Colab may not always have GPUs ready all the time, and may deny you a GPU when you have used them a lot. When you are temporarily 'locked out', you can switch to a non-GPU runtime or to a local instance of Jupyter running on your machine.

# ### Constraints
# * Your stored models should not be larger than 100MB when stored in file. GitHub will not allow uploading if they are.
# * When questions ask you to provide an explanation, it should be less than 500
# characters long. Some questions have a higher limit. Always answer in full sentences.
# * Don't train for more than 100 epochs, i.e. don't throw excessing computational resources at the problem. If your model hasn't converged by then, think of ways it could be made to converge faster. In this assignment you are not after the last tiny improvement, you can stop when learning curves flatten out. Do at least 5 epochs to get a reasonable learning curve.

# ### Grading
# Grading is based on the following aspects:
# * Correctness in answering the question. Carefully read the question and answer
# what is asked for. Train your models on the correct data. It should be clear on which data should be trained, but ask when in doubt. When something is not defined (e.g. the number of epochs or batch size), you can freely choose them.
# * Clarity of your explanations. Write short but precise descriptions of what you did and why. Give short but clear explanations of the observed performance. 
# After your explanation, your approach and model should make perfect sense. Refrain from using symbols as substitute for words in your explanation (e.g. no: "More layers -> more parameters" yes: "More layers mean more parameters"). 
# * Part of your grade depends on how well your model performs. When the question says 'you should at least get x%', x% will give you a good but not the maximal grade. You can get the full grade when you are close to what is the expected maximal performance. You don't need to invest lots of effort into the last tiny improvement, though. Unless specified, we look at the accuracy on the validation set. If your learning curves are very erratic we'll compute a score based on the smoothed curves (i.e. single peaks don't count).
# * The weight of each question is indicated. Take this into account when planning your time.

# ### Other tips
# * Don't wait until the last minute to do the assignment. The models take time to train, most questions will require some thinking, and some require you to read up on some new concepts.
# * Take care that you upload the results as requested. You need to submit not only the notebooks but also the trained models and learning curves (training histories). Be sure to run the verification script and check that all the results are included.
# * We provide an evaluation function that also stored models to disk. After you are done training the model, set the 'train' attribute to False so that the model doesn't train again (and loads from file instead) when you restart and rerun your notebook.
# * Explore. For many questions we'll ask you to explain your model design decisions. You cannot magically know the best solutions but you can experiment
# based on your understanding and make decisions based on both your knowledge and experiments. Your explanation is at least as important as the performance of your model.
# * Be original. We will check for plagiarism between student submissions.

# ### Data
# The [Street View House Numbers Dataset](https://www.openml.org/d/41081) contains 32-by-32 RGB images centered around a single digit of a house number appearing in Google Street View. Many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides. It consists of 10 classes, 1 for each digit. Digit '1' has label 1, '9' has label 9 and '0' has label 10. Your goal is to build models that recognize the correct digit.

# If you use Colab, uncomment the following to cache the dataset inside the VM. This will make reloading faster if you need to restart your notebook. After longer periods of inactivity, your VM may be recycled and the cache lost, in which case the dataset will be downloaded again. Also note that this dataset is about 1Gb large, and will take even more space in memory. You may need to switch to a high-RAM environment (Colab will ask you if you hit the limit).

# ### Evaluation harness
# We provide an evaluation function 'run_evaluation' that you should use to 
# evaluate all your models. It also stores the trained models to disk so that
# your submission can be quickly verified, as well as to avoid having to train
# them over and over again. Your last run of the evaluation function (the last one
# stored to file), is the one that will be evaluated. The 'train' argument indicates whether to train or to load from disk. We have provided helper functions for saving and loading models to/from file, assuming you use TensorFlow. If you use PyTorch you'll have to adapt them.

# - Build a dense network (with only dense layers) of at least 3 layers that is shaped like a pyramid: The first layer must have many nodes, and every subsequent layer must have increasingly fewer nodes, e.g. half as many. Implement a function 'build_model_1_1' that returns this model.
# - You can explore different settings, but don't use any preprocessing or regularization yet. You should be able to achieve at least 70% accuracy, but more is of course better. Unless otherwise stated, you can use accuracy as the evaluation metric in all questions.
# * Add a small description of your design choices (max. 500 characters) in 'answer_q_1_1': explain what you did and also why. Also discuss the performance of the model. Is it working well? Both the performance of the model and your explanations matter.
# - The name of the model should be 'model_1_1'. Evaluate it using the 'run_evaluation' function. For this question, you should not use more than 50 epochs.

# ### Question 4.2 Embeddings and pipelines (5 points)
# - Generate embeddings of the original images by running them through the trained convolutional part of model_4_1 (without the dense layer) and returning the output. Embed the training and test data and store them to disk using the helper functions below. Implement a function `store_embeddings` that loads model_4_1 and stores all necessary embeddings to file. Make sure to run it once so that the embeddings are stored (and submitted).
# - Implement a function 'generate_pipeline' that returns an scikit-learn pipeline. You can use any non-deep learning technique (eg. SVMs, RFs,...), and preprocessing technique. You can do model selection using the validation set. 
# - Implement a function 'evaluate_pipeline' that evaluates a given pipeline on a given training and test set. 
# - Implement a function 'evaluation_4_2' that evaluates your pipeline on the embedded training and test set (loaded from file) and returns the accuracy. 
# - Describe what you did and what you observed. Report the obtained accuracy score. Can you beat your best model thus far?
